<div class="text-block-45"><p></p>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: pinctrl: core: delete incorrect free in pinctrl_enable() The "pctldev" struct is allocated in devm_pinctrl_register_and_init().</p></div>
<div class="text-block-45"><p></p>It's a devm_ managed pointer that is freed by devm_pinctrl_dev_release(), so freeing it in pinctrl_enable() will lead to a double free.</p></div>
